# FP_Shortcuts
Shortcuts by tapping/pressing fingerprint sensor on the back of the phone.

This app is optimized for the Nexus 5x and Nexus 6p and is used to create 
and manage shortcuts utilizing the fingerprint sensor on the backs of the
phone. 

We thought that this was an additional use of the fingerprint sensor on
the back of the phone. We wanted to make more uses for the fingerprint
sensor than just unlocking the phone and certain apps.
